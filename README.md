# KDE-plots-to-EURs
currently showing how distributions change over vintage year in select DSU areas

Simple workflow testing using a combined panda of RSEG OL outputs and Combocurve Outputs

Combined data in excel (need to combine in pandas next time)

Created a Basic stat plots table

Created a KDE plot for all wells in the subset

Observation takeaway appears that older wells had a much wider distribution and new wells had a much tighter distribution.  Next step is to look at all on seperate plots

Created a KDE plot by vintage year in seperate plots to confirm previous observation
